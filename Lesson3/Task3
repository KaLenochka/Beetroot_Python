# The name check.
# Write a program that has a variable with your name stored (in lowercase)
# and then asks for your name as input.
# The program should check if your input is equal to the stored name
# even if the given name has another case, e.g., if your input is “Anton”
# and the stored name is “anton”, it should return True.
