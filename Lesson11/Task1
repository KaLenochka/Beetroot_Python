# Task 1
# School
# Make a class structure in python representing people at school. Make a base class called Person,
# a class called Student, and another one called Teacher. Try to find as many methods and attributes as you can
# which belong to different classes, and keep in mind which are common and which are not.
# For example, the name should be a Person attribute, while salary should only be available to the teacher.
