# Task 2
# Write a function that takes in two numbers from the user via input(), call the numbers a and b,
# and then returns the value of squared a divided by b,
# construct a try-except block which raises an exception if the two values given by the input function were not numbers,
# and if value b was zero (cannot divide by zero).
