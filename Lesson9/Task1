# Task 1
# Files
# Write a script that creates a new output file called myfile.txt and writes the string "Hello file world!" in it.
# Then write another script that opens myfile.txt, and reads and prints its contents.
# Run your two scripts from the system command line.
# Does the new file show up in the directory where you ran your scripts?
# What if you add a different directory path to the filename passed to open?
# Note: file write methods do not add newline characters to your strings; add an explicit ‘\n’
# at the end of the string if you want to fully terminate the line in the file.

with open('myfile.txt', 'w') as hello_file:
    hello_file.write('Hello file world!\n')

with open('myfile.txt') as hello_file:
    text_from_file = hello_file.read()
print(text_from_file)

# Run your two scripts from the system command line. - DONE
# Does the new file show up in the directory where you ran your scripts? - NO. I WAS AT THE FOLDER OF PYCHARM,
# BUT NEW FILE SHOWED UP IN THE DIRECTORY WHERE THE PYTHON IS!
# What if you add a different directory path to the filename passed to open? - I TRIED, BUT DIDN'T HAVE SUCCESS
