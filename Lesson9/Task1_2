# Task 1_2
# Then write another script that opens myfile.txt, and reads and prints its contents.
# Run your two scripts from the system command line.
# Does the new file show up in the directory where you ran your scripts?
# What if you add a different directory path to the filename passed to open?
# Note: file write methods do not add newline characters to your strings; add an explicit ‘\n’
# at the end of the string if you want to fully terminate the line in the file.
